# work-day-scheduler

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to creat a work day schedule for a user. This planner contains the current date when opened. It also contains a time block for each hour of a typical work day. Each time block is color coded to indicate whether the time block is in the future, present or past. The time block can be typed in and the text can be saved by the user. When the user clicks the save button, the information typed in the time blocks remains even after the page is reloaded.
